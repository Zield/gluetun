This is the visi how to guide.
Go to docker generator.js
Choose the regions you want to use and check the current surfshark api credentials are correct
run the command node docker_generator.js to generate the composer file to create the gluetun vpn gateways and link them to the latest build of visi at zield1201
Once that is done you need to check the latest version of the visi at the zield1201 gitlab repository has the latest code.
Once all good, go to terminal and type docker-compose up
It will launch all the required gluetuns and pull the correct visi build to use
And awwwwaaaaay we go!
